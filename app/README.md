A vanilla web-app to automate most of the process. 
The cavet though is that you will need a developer account to use it (you could go ahead and get one, it's free),
specifically a valid Client_ID and Client_Secret to use Strava-API-v3.

To run the app...
>* `sudo apt update`
>* `sudo apt install jq`
>* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
>* `python server.py`

**Note:** This is a very naive implementation and might have some bugs. Feel free to raise an issue if so.
